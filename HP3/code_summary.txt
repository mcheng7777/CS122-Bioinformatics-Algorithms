	I separated the paired ends and created a dictionary of read IDs (from 1-20000) and their 

respective k-mer composition (k chosen as 30), as well as another dictionary of unique k-mers among 

all the reads and their respective read ID and position in the read. To remove errors, I counted 

the k-mer abundances and filtered out erroneous k-mers as those with an abundance of 5 or below. 

For the Debruijn graph, I quantified the nodes by identifying the number of occurrences of a k-mer 

in the genome by their abundance in the reads, setting a count of <30 or 30-60 as 1 occurrence in 

the genome, 60-90 as 2 occurrences, etc. I then implemented a Debruijn graph with adjacency lists 

and used the k-mer dictionary I created to map contigs to the reads, which provided context for 

traversing the Debruijn graph more accurately.
